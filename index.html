    <h1>Instructions For Simon Game</h1>
    <h2>How the Game Works?</h2>
     <h3>The game starts when you hit any key from the keyboard</h3>
     <p>As soon as you enter any key one of the four colours will flash.Now you have to click on the flashed button.That will send you to level 2::Now again one of the 4 colours will flash.But now since you are in level 2 .You have to click 2 colours one by one.One from the previous level and one from the current Level:
         You actually need to remember which colour flashed in level 1,2,3,4 and so on.If you are on level i you need to click on colours from level 1 to level i.
